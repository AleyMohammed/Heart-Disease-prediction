# Heart Disease Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify whether a person has heart disease or not. The model is trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and is based on the following diagnostic features:

- **age**: Age of the individual
- **sex**: Gender of the individual
- **cp**: Chest pain type
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- **target**: The output class (1 = has heart disease; 0 = no heart disease)

The SVM model was trained and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on these features. This project aims to contribute to the development of tools that assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
